An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)
with cytotoxicity conjugated to an
having a drug
antibody, whose
antigen is expressed on the surface of cancer cells and
which also binds to an antigen capable of cellular
internalization, and therefore can deliver the drug
selectively to cancer cells, is thus expected to cause
accumulation of the drug within cancer cells and to
kill the cancer cells (see, Non-patent Literatures 1 to
3) . As Mylotarg (registered trademark;
Gemtuzumab
conjugated
an ADC,
ozogamicin) in
to an anti-CD33
which
antibody
cal icheamicin is
is approved as a
therapeutic agent for acute myeloid leukemia. Further,
Adcetris (registered trademark; Brentuximab vedotin),
in which auristatin E is conjugated to an anti-CD30
antibody, has recently been approved as a therapeutic
agent for Hodgkin's lymphoma and anaplastic large cell
lymphoma (see, Non-patent Literature 4). The drugs
contained in ADCs which have been approved until now
target DNA or tubulin.

With regard to an antitumor agent, camptothecin
derivatives, low-molecular-weight compounds that
inhibit topoisomerase I to exhibit an antitumor effect,
are known. Among these, an anti tumor compound

de]pyrano[3' ,4' :6,7]indolizino[l,2-b]quinolin-
10, 13 (9H, 15H) -dione) is a water soluble derivative of
camptothecin (Patent Literatures 1 and 2). Unlike
irinotecan currently used in clinical settings, this
compound does not require activation by an enzyme for
exhibiting its anti tumor effect. Further, its
inhibitory activity on topoisomerase I was observed to
be higher than SN-38 which is the main pharmaceutically
active substance of irinotecan and topotecan also used
in clinical settings, and higher in vitro cytocidal
activity was confirmed against various cancer eel ls.
In particular, it was confirmed to have the effect
against cancer cells that have resistance to SN-38 or
the like due to expression of P-glycoprotein. Further,
in a human tumor subcutaneously transplanted mouse
model, it was confirmed to have a potent antitumor
effect, and thus has undergone clinical studies, but
has not been placed on the market yet (see, Non-patent
Literatures 5 to 10) . It remains unclear whether or
not exatecan acts effectively as an ADC.

DE-310 is a complex in which exatecan is
conjugated to a biodegradable carboxymethyldextran
polyalcohol polymer via a GGFG peptide spacer (Patent
Literature 3). By converting exatecan into the form of
a polymer prodrug, a high blood retention property can
be maintained and also a high targeting property to
tumor areas is passively increased by utilizing the
increased permeability of newly formed blood vessels
within tumors and retention property in tumor tissues.
With DE-310, through cleavage of the peptide spacer by
enzyme, exatecan and exatecan with glycine connected to
an amino group are continuously released as main active
substance, and as a result, the pharmacokinet ics are
improved. DE-310 was found to have higher
effectiveness than exatecan administered alone even
though the total dosage of exatecan contained in D310
is lower than in the case of administration of exatecan
alone according to various tumor evaluation models in
non-clinical studies. A clinical study was conducted
for DE-310, and effective cases were also confirmed,
including a report suggesting that the main active
substance accumulates in tumors more than in normal
tissues. However, there is also a
that accumulation of DE-310
substance in tumors is not
and
much
report indicating
the main active
different from
accumulation in normal tissues in humans, and thus no
passive targeting is observed in humans (see, Non-
- 4 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
patent Literatures 11 to 14) As a result, DE-310 was
not also commercialized, and it remains unclear whether
or not exatecan effectively acts as a drug directed to
such targeting.
[0007]
As a compound relating to DE-310, a complex in
which a structure moiety represented by -NH-(CH2) 4-
C(=O)- is inserted between the -GGFG- spacer and
exatecan to form -GGFG-NH-(CH2)4-C{=O)- used as a
spacer structure is also known (Patent Literature 4).
However, the anti tumor effect of said complex is not
known at all.

HER2 is one
factor receptor
epidermal cell
of the products
type oncogene
growth factor
of a typical growth
identified as human
receptor 2-related
oncogene, and is a transmembrane receptor protein
having a molecular weight of 185 kDa and having a
tyrosine kinase domain (Non-patent Literature 15). The
DNA sequence and amino acid sequence of HER2 are
disclosed on a public database, and can be referred to,
for example, under Accession No. M11730 (GenBank),
NP 004439.2 (NCBI), or the like.
HER2 (neu, ErbB-2) is one of the members of the
EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) family and is
activated by autophosphorylation at intracellular
tyrosine residues by its homodimer formation or
heterodimer formation with another EGFR receptor HERl

(EGFR, ErbB-1), HER3 (ErbB-3), or HER4 (ErbB-4) (Nonpatent
Literatures 16 to 18), thereby playing an
important role in cell growth, differentiation, and
survival in normal cells and cancer cells (Non-patent
Literatures 19 and 20). HER2 is overexpressed in
various cancer types such as breast cancer, gastric
cancer, and ovarian cancer (Non-patent Literatures 21
to 26) and has been reported to be a negative prognosis
factor for breast cancer (Non-patent Literatures 27 and
28) .
[0009]
Trastuzumab is a humanized antibody of a mouse
anti-HER2 antibody 4D5 (Non-patent Literature 29 and
Patent Literature 5), named as recombinant humanized
anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (huMAb4D5-8, rhuMAb HER2,
Herceptin (R)) (Patent Literature 6) . Trastuzumab
specifically binds to
HER2 and induces
the extracellular domain IV of
antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC) or exerts an anticancer effect via
the inhibition of signal transduction from HER2 (Nonpatent
Literatures 30 and 31). Trastuzumab is highly
effective for tumors overexpressing HER2 (Non-patent
Literature 32) and as such, was launched in 1999 in the
USA and in 2001 in Japan as a therapeutic agent for
patients with metastatic breast cancer overexpressing
HER2.
Although the therapeutic effect of trastuzumab on
breast cancer has been adequately proven (Non-patent
- 6 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
Literature 3 3) , allegedly about 15% of patients with
breast cancer overexpressing HER2 who have received a
wide range of conventional anticancer therapies are
responders to trastuzumab. About 85% of patients of
this population have no or merely weak response to
trastuzumab treatment.
[0010]
Thus, the need for a therapeutic agent targeting
HER2 expression-related diseases has been recognized
for patients affected by tumors overexpressing HER2
with no or weak response to trastuzumab or HER2-related
disorders. T-DMl (trastuzumab emtansine, Kadcyla (R);
Non-patent Literature 34) having an antitumor drug
conjugated to trastuzumab via a linker structure, and
pertuzumab (Perjeta(R); Non-patent Literature 35 and
Patent Literature 7) designed to target the
extracellular domain II of HER2 and inhibit heterodimer
formation have been developed. However, their
responsiveness, activity strength,
indications are still insufficient,
unsatisfied needs for targeting HER2.

[Summary of Invention]
[Technical Problem]
[0013]
With regard to the treatment of tumors by
antibodies, an insufficient antitumor effect may be
observed even when the
to bind to tumor cells,
antibody recognizes
and there are cases
an antigen
in which a
more effective antitumor antibody is needed. Further,
many antitumor low-molecular-weight compounds have
problems in safety like side effects and toxicity even
if the compounds have an excellent antitumor effect. It
has remained an objective to achieve a superior
therapeutic effect by further enhancing safety. Thus,
an object of the present invention is to provide an
antitumor drug having an excellent therapeutic effect,
which is excellent in terms of antitumor effect and
safety.
[Solution to Problem]
[ 0014]
The inventors considered that an anti-HER2
antibody is an antibody which is capable of targeting
tumor cells, that is, having a property of recognizing
tumor cells, a property of binding to tumor cells, a
property of internalizing within tumor
cytotoxic activity against tumor cells, a
activity against tumor cells, or the like;
- 11 -
4833-0752-7733.1
cells, a
cytocidal
thus, when
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
the antitumor compound exatecan is converted into an
antibody-drug conjugate, via a linker structure moiety,
by conjugation to this antibody, the antitumor compound
can be more surely delivered to tumor cells to
specifically exhibit the antitumor effect of the
compound in tumor cells, and thus the antitumor effect
can be surely exhibited and also an enhanced cytocidal
effect of the anti-HER2 antibody can be expected, and
the dose of the antitumor compound can be reduced
compared to the case of administering the compound
alone, and thus influences of the antitumor compound on
normal cells can be alleviated so that a higher safety
can be achieved.
In this connection, the inventors created a linker
with a specific structure and succeeded in obtaining an
antibody-drug conjugate in which the anti-HER2 antibody
and exatecan are conjugated to each other via the
linker, and confirmed an excellent antitumor effect
exhibited by the conjugate to thereby complete the
present invention.

The embodiments described below are given
illustrating one example of a typical
of the present invention and are not
intended to limit the scope of the present invention.

Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
The anti-HER2 antibody used in the anti-HER2
antibody-drug conjugate of the present invention may be
derived from any species, and preferred examples of the
species can include humans, rats, mice, and rabbits.
In case when the antibody is derived from other than
human species, it is preferably chimerized or humanized
using a well known technique. The antibody of the
present invention may be a polyclonal antibody or a
monoclonal antibody and is preferably a monoclonal
antibody.
The anti-HER2 antibody is the antibody, which is
capable of targeting tumor cells, that is, possesses a
property of recognizing a tumor cell, a property of
binding to a tumor cell, a property of internalizing in
a tumor cell, cytocidal activity against tumor cells,
or the like, and can be conjugated with a drug having
antitumor activity via a linker to form an antibodydrug
conjugate.
The binding activity of the antibody against tumor
cells can be confirmed using flow cytometry. The
internalization of the antibody into tumor cells can be
confirmed using (1) an assay of visualizing an antibody
incorporated in cells under a

binding to the therapeutic
fluorescence microscope

labeled) binding to the therapeutic antibody (Molecular
Biology of the Cell, Vol. 15, 5268-5282, December 2004),
or (3) a Mab-ZAP assay using an immunotoxin binding to
the therapeutic antibody wherein the toxin is released
upon incorporation into cells to inhibit cell growth
(Bio Techniques 28: 162-165, January 2000). As the
immunotoxin, a recombinant complex protein of a
diphtheria toxin catalytic domain and protein G may be
used.
The antitumor activity of the antibody can be
confirmed in vitro by determining inhibitory activity
against cell growth. For example, a cancer cell line
overexpressing a target protein for the antibody is
cultured, and the antibody is added at varying
concentrations into the culture system to determine an
inhibitory activity against focus formation, colony
formation, and spheroid growth. The antitumor activity
can be confirmed in vivo, for example, by administering
the antibody to a nude mouse with a transplanted tumor
cell line highly expressing the target protein, and
determining change in the cancer cell.
Since the compound conjugated in the antibody-drug
conjugate exerts an antitumor effect, it is preferred
but not essential that the antibody itself should have
an antitumor effect. For the purpose of specifically
and selectively exerting the cytotoxic activity of the
antitumor compound against tumor cells, it is important
- 38 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
and also preferred that the antibody should have the
property of internalizing to migrate into tumor cells.
[0043]
The anti-HER2 antibody can be obtained by a
procedure known in the art. For example, the antibody
of the present invention can be obtained using a method
usually carried out in the art, which involves
immunizing animals with an antigenic polypeptide and
collecting and purifying antibodies produced in vivo.
The origin of the antigen is not limited to humans, and
the animals may be immunized with an antigen derived
from a non-human animal such as a mouse, a rat and the
like. In this case, the cross-reactivity of antibodies
binding to the obtained heterologous antigen with human
antigens can be tested to screen for an antibody
applicable to a human disease.

antigenic protein. Specifically, vectors that permit
expression of the antigen gene are prepared and

antibody can also be obtained by a method of immunizing
animals with the above-described genetically engineered
antigen-expressing cells or a cell line expressing the
antigen.

[0045]
Hereinafter, the anti-HER2 antibody used in the
invention is described.
The terms "cancer" and "tumor" as used herein are
used with the same meaning.
- 41 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
The term "gene" as used herein includes not only
DNA, but also mRNA thereof, cDNA thereof and cRNA
thereof.
The term "polynucleotide" as used herein is used
with the same meaning as a nucleic acid and also
includes DNA, RNA, probes, oligonucleotides, and
primers.
The terms "polypeptide", "protein" and "protein"
as used herein are used without distinction.
The term "cell" as used herein also includes cells
in an animal individual and cultured cells.
The term "HER2" as used herein is used with the
same meaning as HER2 protein.
Examples of the anti-HER2 antibody as used herein
can include, but not particularly limited to,
pertuzumab (International Patent Publication No. WO
01/00245) and trastuzumab (U.S. Patent No. 5821337).
Trastuzumab is preferred. However, the anti-HER2
antibody of the present invention is not limited
thereto as long as it is an anti-HER2 antibody
specifically binding to HER2, and more preferably
having an activity of internalizing in HER2-expressing
cells by binding to HER2.
The term "trastuzumab" as used herein is also
called HERCEPTIN(R), huMAb4D5-8, or rhuMAb4D5-8 and is
a humanized antibody comprising a heavy chain
consisting of an amino acid sequence consisting of
amino acid residues 1 to 449 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (Fig. 1)
- 42 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
and a light chain consisting of an amino acid sequence
consisting of amino acid residues 1 to 214 of SEQ ID
NO: 2 (Fig. 2)
The term "specifically binding" as used herein
means binding that is not nonspecific adsorption.
Examples of the criterion for determining whether the
binding is specific or not can include dissociation
constant (hereinafter referred to as "KD"). The KD
value of the antibody for the HER2 protein is
preferably 1 X 10-5 M or smaller, 5 X 10-6 M or smaller,
2 X 10-6 M or smaller, or 1 X 10-6 M or smaller, more
preferably 5 X 10-7 M or smaller, 2 X 10-7 M or smaller,

or smaller, 2 X 10-8 M or smaller, or 1 x 10-8 M or
smaller, and most preferably 5 X 10-9 Mor smaller, 2 x
10-9 M or smaller, or 1 X 10-9 M or smaller. The
binding between the HER2 protein and the antibody can
be measured using a method known in the art, such as
surface plasmon resonance, ELISA, or RIA.
The term "CDR" as used herein refers to a
complementarity determining region (CDR) It is known
that each heavy and light chain of an antibody molecule
has three complementarity determining regions ( CDRs) .
The CDR is also called the hypervariable domain, and is
present in a variable region of each heavy and light
chain of an antibody. It is a site which has unusually
high variability in its primary structure, and there
are three separate CDRs in the primary structure of
- 43 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
each heavy and light polypeptide chain. In this
specification, as for the CDRs of an antibody, the CDRs
of the heavy chain are represented by CDRHl, CDRH2, and
CDRH3 from the amino-terminal side of the amino acid
sequence of the heavy chain, and the CDRs of the light
chain are represented by CDRLl, CDRL2, and CDRL3 from
the amino-terminal side of the amino acid sequence of
the light chain. These sites are proximate to one
another in the tertiary structure and determine the
specificity for an antigen to which the antibody binds.
The phrase "hybridization is performed under
stringent conditions" as used herein refers to a
process in which hybridization is performed under
conditions under which identification can be achieved
by performing hybridization at 68°C in a commercially
available hybridization solution ExpressHyb
Hybridization Solution (manufactured by Clontech, Inc.)
or by performing hybridization at 68°C in the presence
of 0.7 to 1.0 M NaCl using a filter having DNA
immobilized thereon, followed by performing washing at
68°C using 0.1 to 2 x SSC solution (1 x SSC solution is
composed of 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) or
under conditions equivalent thereto.

2-related
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
oncogene, and is a transmembrane receptor protein
having a molecular weight of 185 kDa and having a
tyrosine kinase domain. HER2 is a member of the EGFR
family consisting of HERl (EGFR, ErbB-1), HER2 (neu,
ErbB-2), HER3 (ErbB-3), and HER4 (ErbB-4) and is known
to be autophosphorylated at intracellular tyrosine
residues by its homodimer formation or heterodimer
formation with another EGFR receptor HERl, HER3, or
HER4 and is itself activated in that manner, thereby
playing an important role in cell growth,
differentiation, and survival in normal cells and tumor
cells.
As for the HER2 protein to be used in the present
invention, the HER2 protein can be directly purified
from HER2-expressing cells of a human or a non-human
mammal (such as a rat or a mouse) and used, or a cell
membrane fraction of the above-described eel ls can be
prepared and used. Further, HER2 can be obtained by in
vitro synthesis thereof or production thereof in a host
cell through genetic engineering. In the genetic
engineering, specifically, after HER2 cDNA is
integrated into a vector capable of expressing HER2
cDNA, the HER2 protein can be obtained by synthesizing
it in a solution containing an enzyme, a substrate and
an energy substance required for transcription and
translation, or by expressing HER2 in another
prokaryotic or eucaryotic transformed host cell.
Alternatively, the above-described genetically
- 45 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
engineered HER2-expressing cells, or a cell line
expressing HER2 may be used as the HER2 protein.
The DNA sequence and amino acid sequence of HER2
are disclosed on a public database, and can be referred
to, for example, under Accession No. M11730 (GenBank),
NP 004439.2 (NCBI), or the like.
Further, a protein which consists of an amino acid
sequence wherein one or several
substituted, deleted and/or added in
amino acids are
any of the abovedescribed
amino acid sequences of HER2 and also has a
biological activity equivalent to that of the protein
is also included in HER2.
Human HER2 protein is composed of a signal
sequence consisting of N-terminal 22 amino acid
residues, an extracellular domain consisting of 630
amino acid residues, a transmembrane domain consisting
of 23 amino acid residues, and an intracellular domain
consisting of 580 amino acid residues.
[0047]
2. Production of anti-HER2 antibody
The antibody against HER2 of the present invention
can be obtained according to, for example, a method
usually carried out in the art, which involves
immunizing animals with HER2 or an arbitrary
polypeptide selected from the amino acid sequence of
HER2 and collecting and purifying antibodies produced
in vivo. The biological species of HER2 to be used as
an antigen is not limited to being human, and an animal
- 46 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
can be immunized with HER2 derived from an animal other
than humans such as a mouse or a rat or with rat
pl85neu. In this case, by examining the crossreactivity
between an antibody binding to the obtained
heterologous HER2 and human HER2, an antibody
applicable to a human disease can be selected.
Further, a monoclonal antibody can be obtained
from a hybridoma established by fusing antibodyproducing
cells which produce an antibody against HER2
with myeloma cells according to a known method ( for
example, Kohler and Milstein, Nature, (1975) 256, pp.
495-497; Kennet, R. ed., Monoclonal Antibodies, pp.
365-367, Plenum Press, N.Y. (1980)).
HER2 to be used as an antigen can be obtained by
expressing HER2 gene in a host cell using genetic
engineering.
Specifically, a vector capable of expressing HER2
gene is produced, and the resulting vector is
transfected into a host cell to express the gene, and
then, the expressed HER2 is purified.
Alternatively, the above-described genetically
engineered HER2-expressing cells, or a cell line
expressing HER2 may be used as the HER2 protein. The
anti-HER2 antibody can be obtained by a preocedure
known in the art. Hereinafter, a method of obtaining
an antibody against HER2 is specifically described.

for producing
a polypeptide
consisting of a partial amino acid sequence comprising
at least 6 consecutive amino acids of HER2, or a
derivative obtained by adding a given amino acid
sequence or carrier thereto.
HER2 can be purified directly from human tumor
tissues or tumor cells and used. Further, HER2 can be
obtained by synthesizing it in vitro or by producing it
in a host cell by genetic engineering.
With respect to the genetic engineering,
specifically, after HER2 cDNA is integrated into a
vector capable of expressing HER2 cDNA, HER2 can be
obtained by synthesizing it in a solution containing an
enzyme, a substrate and an energy substance required
for transcription and translation, or by expressing
HER2 in another prokaryotic or eucaryotic transformed
host cell.
Further, the antigen can also be obtained as a
secretory protein by expressing a fusion protein
obtained by ligating the extracellular domain of HER2,
which is a membrane protein, to the constant region of
an antibody in an appropriate host-vector system.
HER2 cDNA can be obtained by, for example, a socalled
PCR method in which a polymerase chain reaction
is performed using a cDNA library expressing HER2 cDNA
as a template and primers which specifically amplify

however, the cells are not limited thereto.
The thus obtained transformant can be cultured
according to a method usually carried out in the art,

A recombinant protein produced intracellularly or
extracellularly by the trans formant through such
culturing can be separated and purified by any of
various known separation methods utilizing the physical
or chemical property of the protein.
Specific examples of the methods include treatment
with a common protein precipitant, ultrafiltration,
various types of liquid chromatography such as
molecular sieve chromatography (gel filtration),
adsorption chromatography, ion exchange chromatography,
and affinity chromatography, dialysis, and a
combination thereof.
Further, by attaching a tag of six histidine
residues to a recombinant protein to be expressed, the
protein can be efficiently purified with a nickel
affinity column. Alternatively, by attaching the IgG
Fe region to a recombinant protein to be expressed, the
protein can be efficiently purified with a protein A
column.

4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
By combining the above-described methods, a large
amount of a target polypeptide can be easily produced
in high yield and high purity.
The above-described transformant itself may be
used as the antigen. A cell line expressing HER2 may
also be used as the antigen. Examples of such a cell
line can include human breast cancer lines SK-BR-3, BT-
474, KPL-4, and JIMT-1, a human gastric cancer line
NCI-N87, and a human ovarian cancer line SK-OV-3. The
cell line of the present invention is not limited to
these cell lines as long as it expresses HER2.
[0049]
(2) Production of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody
Examples of the antibody specifically bind to HER2
include a monoclonal antibody specifically bind to HER2,
and a method of obtaining such antibody is as described
below.
The production of a monoclonal antibody generally
requires the following operational steps of:
(a) purifying a biopolymer to be used as an
antigen, or preparing antigen-expressing cells;
(b) preparing antibody-producing cells by
immunizing an animal by injection of the antigen,
collecting the blood, assaying its antibody titer to
determine when the spleen is excised;
(c) preparing myeloma cells (hereinafter referred
to as "myeloma") ;
- 51 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
(d) fusing the antibody-producing cells with the
myeloma;
(e) screening a group of hybridomas producing a
desired antibody;
(f) dividing the hybridomas
clones (cloning);
into single cell
(g) optionally, culturing the hybridoma or rearing
an animal implanted with the hybridoma for producing a
large amount of monoclonal antibody;
(h) examining the thus produced monoclonal
antibody for biological activity and binding
specificity, or assaying the same for properties as a
labeled reagent; and the like.
Hereinafter, the method of producing a monoclonal
antibody will be described in detail following the
above steps, however, the method is not limited thereto,
and, for example, antibody-producing cells other than
spleen cells and myeloma can be used.
[0050]
(a) Purification of antigen
As the antigen, HER2 prepared by the method as
described above or a partial peptide thereof can be
used.
Further, a membrane fraction prepared from
recombinant cells expressing HER2 the recombinant
cells expressing HER2 themselves,

a partial
chemically
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
synthesized by a method known to those skilled in the
art can also be used as the antigen.
Furthermore, a HER2-expressing cell line can also
be used as the antigen.
[0051]
(b) Preparation of antibody-producing cells
The antigen obtained in the step (a) is mixed with
an adj uvant such as Freund' s complete or incomplete
adjuvant or auxiliary agent such as aluminum potassium
sulfate and the resulting mixture is used as an
immunogen to immunize an experimental animal. Another
method involves immunizing an experimental animal with
antigen-expressing cells as an immunogen. As the
experimental animal, any animal used in a known
hybridoma production method can be used without
hindrance. Specifically, for example, a mouse, a rat,
a goat, sheep, cattle, a horse, or the like can be used.
However, from the viewpoint of ease of availability of
myeloma cells to be fused with the extracted antibodyproducing
cells, a mouse or a rat is preferably used as
the animal to be immunized.
Further, the strain of a mouse or a rat to be used
is not particularly limited, and in the case of a mouse,

As the animal to be immunized, in consideration of
compatibility of fusing with myeloma cells described

the case of a rat, Wistar and Low strains are
particularly preferred.
Further, in consideration of antigenic homology
between humans and mice, it is also preferred to use a
mouse having decreased biological function to remove
auto-antibodies, that is, a mouse with an autoimmune
disease.
The age of such mouse or rat at the time of

Among these
specific method
immunization methods, a preferred
in the present invention is, for
example, as follows.
That is, first, a membrane protein fraction
serving as the antigen or cells caused to express the
antigen is/are intradermally or intraperitoneally
administrated to an animal. However, the combination
of both routes of administration is preferred for
increasing
intradermal
the immunization
administration is
efficiency,
performed in
and when
the first
half and intraperitoneal administration is performed in
the latter half or only at the last dosing, the
immunization efficiency can be particularly increased.
The administration schedule of the antigen varies
depending on the type of animal to be immunized,
individual difference or the like. However, in general,
an administration schedule in which the frequency of
administration of the antigen is 3
dosing interval is 2 to 6 weeks is
administration schedule in which
administration of the antigen is 3
to 6 times and the
preferred, and an
the frequency of
to 4 times and the
dosing interval is 2 to 4 weeks is more preferred.
Further, the dose of the antigen varies depending
on the type of animal, individual differences or the
like, however, the dose is generally set to 0.05 to 5
mg, preferably about 0.1 to 0.5 mg.
A booster immunization is performed 1 to 6 weeks,
preferably 1 to 4 weeks, more preferably 1 to 3 weeks
- 55 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
after the administration of the antigen as described
above. When the immunogen is cells, 1 X 10 6 to 1 X 10 7
cells are used.
The dose of the antigen at the time of performing
the booster immunization varies depending on the type
or size of animal or the like, however, in the case of,
for example, a mouse, the dose is generally set to 0.05
to 5 mg, preferably 0. 1 to 0. 5 mg, more preferably
about 0.1 to 0.2 mg. When the immunogen is cells, 1 X
10 6 to 1 X 10 7 cells are used.
Spleen cells or lymphocytes including antibodyproducing
cells are aseptically from the
immunized animal after 1 to 10 days,
days, more preferably 2 to 3 days
immunization. At this time, the
removed
preferably 2 to 5
from the booster
antibody titer is
measured, and if an animal having a sufficiently
increased antibody titer is used as a supply source of
the antibody-producing cells, the subsequent procedure
can be carried out more efficiently.
Examples of the method of measuring the antibody
titer to be used here include an RIA method and an
ELISA method, but the method is not limited thereto.
For example, if an ELISA method is employed, the
measurement of the antibody titer in the invention can
be carried out according to the procedures as described
below.
First, a purified or partially purified antigen is
adsorbed to the surface of a solid phase such as a 96-
- 56 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
well plate for ELISA, and the surface of the solid
phase having no antigen adsorbed thereto is covered
with a protein unrelated to the antigen such as bovine
serum albumin (BSA) . After washing the surface, the
surface is brought into contact with a serially-diluted
sample (for example, mouse serum) as a primary antibody
to allow the antibody in the sample to bind to the
antigen.
Further,
labeled with

allowed to bind to the mouse antibody.
a substrate for the enzyme is added and
absorbance which occurs due to color
development induced by degradation of the substrate or
the like is measured and the antibody titer is
calculated based on the measurement.
The separation of the antibody-producing cells
from the spleen cells or lymphocytes of the immunized
animal can be carried out according to a known method
(for example, Kohler et al., Nature (1975), 256, p.
495; Kohler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. (1977), 6, p. 511;
Milstein et al., Nature (1977), 266, p. 550; Walsh,
Nature (1977), 266, p. 495). For example, in the case
of spleen cells, a general method in which the
antibody-producing cells are separated by homogenizing
the spleen to obtain the cells through filtration with
a stainless steel mesh and suspending the cells in
Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) can be employed.

(c) Preparation of myeloma cells (hereinafter referred
to as "myeloma")
The myeloma cells to be used for cell fusion are
not particularly limited and suitable cells can be
selected from
consideration of
known cell lines. However,
convenience when a hybridoma
in
is
selected from fused cells, it is preferred to use an
HGPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase)
deficient strain whose selection procedure has been
established.
More specifically, examples of the HGPRT-deficient
strain include X63-Ag8(X63), NSl-ANS/l(NSl), P3X63-
Ag8.Ul(P3Ul), X63-Ag8.653(X63.653), SP2/0-Ag14(SP2/0),
MPC11-45.6TG1.7(45.6TG), FO, S149/5XXO, and BU.1
derived from mice; 210.RSY3.Ag.1.2.3(Y3) derived from
rats; and U266AR(SKO-007), GM1500·GTG-A12(GM1500),
UC729-6, LICR-LOW-HMy2(HMy2) and 8226AR/NIP4-l(NP41)
derived from humans. These HGPRT-deficient strains are
available from, for example, ATCC or the like.
These cell strains are subcultured in an
appropriate medium such as an 8-azaguanine medium [a
medium obtained by adding 8-azaguanine to an RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with glutamine, 2-mercaptoethanol,
gentamicin, and fetal calf serum (hereinafter referred
to as "FCS")], Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium
(hereinafter referred to as "IMDM"), or Dulbecco's
Modified Eagle Medium (hereinafter referred to as
- 58 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
"DMEM"). In this case, 3 to 4 days before performing
cell fusion, the cells are subcultured in a normal
medium (for example, an ASF104 medium (manufactured by
Ajinomoto Co., Ltd.) containing 10% FCS) to ensure not
less than 2 x 10 7 cells on the day of cell fusion.
[0053]
(d) Cell fusion
Fusion between the antibody-producing cells and
the myeloma cells can be appropriately performed
according to a known method (Weir, D. M. Handbook of
Experimental Immunology Vol. I. II. III., Blackwell
Scientific Publications, Oxford (1987); Kabat, E. A.
and Mayer, M. M., Experimental Immunochemistry, Charles
C Thomas Publisher, Springfield, Illinois (1964), etc.),
under conditions such that the survival rate of cells
is not excessively reduced.
As such a method, for example, a chemical method
in which the antibody-producing cells and the myeloma
cells are mixed in a solution containing a polymer such
as polyethylene glycol at a high concentration, a
physical method using electric stimulation, or the like
can be used. Among these methods, a specific example
of the chemical method is as described below.
That is, in the case where polyethylene glycol is
used in the solution containing a polymer at a high
concentration, the antibody-producing cells and the
myeloma cells are mixed in a solution of polyethylene
glycol having a molecular weight of 1500 to 6000, more
- 59 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
preferably 2000 to 4000 at a temperature of from 30 to
4 0°C, preferably from 3 5 to 3 8°C for 1 to 10 minutes,
preferably 5 to 8 minutes.
[0054]
(e) Selection of a group of hybridomas
The method of selecting hybridomas obtained by the
above-described cell fusion is not particularly limited.
Usually, an HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine)
selection method (Kohler et al., Nature (1975), 256, p.
495; Milstein et al., Nature (1977), 266, p. 550) is
used.
This method is effective when hybridomas are
obtained using the myeloma cells of an HGPRT-deficient
strain which cannot survive in the presence of
aminopterin. That is, by culturing unfused cells and
hybridomas in an HAT medium, only hybridomas resistant
to aminopterin are selectively allowed to survive and
proliferate.
[0055]
(f) Division into single cell clone (cloning)
As a cloning method for hybridomas, a known method
such as a methylcellulose method, a soft agarose method,
or a limiting dilution method can be used (see, for
example, Barbara, B. M. and Stanley, M. S.: Selected
Methods in Cellular Immunology, W. H. Freeman and
Company, San Francisco (1980)). Among these methods,
particularly, a three-dimensional culture method such
as a methylcellulose method is preferred. For example,
- 60 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
the group of hybridomas produced by cell fusion are
suspended in a methylcellulose medium such as
ClonaCell-HY Selection Medium D (manufactured by
StemCell Technologies, Inc., #03804) and cultured.
Then, the formed hybridoma colonies are collected,
whereby monoclonal hybridomas can be obtained. The
collected respective hybridoma colonies are cultured,
and a hybridoma which has been confirmed to have a
stable antibody titer in an obtained hybridoma culture
supernatant is selected as a HER2 monoclonal antibodyproducing
hybridoma strain.
[0056]
(g) Preparation of monoclonal antibody by culturing
hybridoma
By culturing the
monoclonal antibody

selected hybridoma, a
efficiently obtained.
However, prior to culturing, it is preferred to perform
screening of a hybridoma which produces a target
monoclonal antibody.
In such screening, a known method can be employed.
The measurement of the antibody titer in the
invention can be carried out by, for example, an ELISA
method explained in item (b)
The hybridoma obtained
above can be stored in a

described
in liquid
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
After completion of cloning, the medium is changed
from an HT medium to a normal medium, and the hybridoma
is cultured.
Large-scale
culture using a
culture is
large culture
performed
bottle

or by

spinner
culture. From the supernatant obtained by the largescale
culture, a monoclonal antibody which specifically
binds to the protein of the invention can be obtained
by purification using a method known to those skilled
in the art such as gel filtration.
Further, the hybridoma is injected into the
abdominal cavity of a mouse of the same strain as the
hybridoma (for example, the above-described BALB/c) or
a Nu/Nu mouse to proliferate the hybridoma, whereby the
ascites containing a large amount of the monoclonal
antibody of the invention can be obtained.
In the case where the hybridoma is administrated
in the abdominal cavity, if a mineral oil such as
2,6,10,14-tetramethyl pentadecane (pristane) is
administrated 3 to 7 days prior thereto, a larger
amount of the ascites can be obtained.
For example, an immunosuppressant is previously
injected into the abdominal cavity of a mouse of the
same strain as the hybridoma to inactivate T cells. 20
days thereafter,

monoclonal
antibody can be obtained at a concentration which is
about 100 times or much higher than that in the culture

The monoclonal antibody obtained by the abovedescribed
method can be purified by a method described
in, for example, Weir, D. M.: Handbook of Experimental
Immunology Vol. I, II, III, Blackwell Scientific
Publications, Oxford (1978)
The thus obtained monoclonal antibody has high
antigen specificity for HER2. Examples of the
monoclonal antibody of the present invention can
include, but are not particularly limited to, a mouse
monoclonal antibody 4D5 (ATCC CRL 10463).
[0057]
(h) Assay of monoclonal antibody
The isotype and subclass of the thus obtained
monoclonal antibody can be determined as follows.
First, examples of the identification method
include an Ouchterlony method, an ELISA method, and an
RIA method.
An Ouchterlony method is simple, but when the
concentration of the monoclonal antibody is low, a
condensation operation is required.
On the other hand, when an ELISA method or an RIA
method is used, by directly reacting the culture
supernatant with an antigen-adsorbed solid phase and
- 63 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
using antibodies corresponding to various types of
immunoglobulin isotypes and subclasses as secondary
antibodies, the isotype and subclass of the monoclonal
antibody can be identified.
In addition, as a simpler method, a commercially
available identification kit (for example, Mouse Typer
Kit manufactured by Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) or the
like can also be used.
Further, the quantitative determination of a
protein can be performed by the Folin Lowry method and
a method of calculation based on the absorbance at 280
nm (1.4 (OD 280) = Immunoglobulin 1 mg/ml)
Further, even when the monoclonal antibody is
separately and independently obtained by performing
again the steps of (a) to (h) in (2), it is possible to
obtain an antibody having a cytotoxic activity
equivalent to that of the HER2 antibody obtained in the
the step of (g). As one example of such an antibody,
an antibody which binds to the same epitope as the HER2
antibody obtained in the step of (g) can be exemplified.
If a newly produced monoclonal antibody binds to a
partial peptide or a partial tertiary structure to
which the anti-HER2 antibody binds, it can be
determined that the monoclonal antibody binds to the
same epi tope as the anti-HER2 antibody. Further, by
confirming that the monoclonal antibody competes with
the anti-HER2 antibody for the binding to HER2 (that is,
the monoclonal antibody inhibits the binding between
- 64 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
the anti-HER2 antibody and HER2), it can be determined
that the monoclonal antibody binds to the same epitope
as the anti-HER2 antibody even if the specific epitope
sequence or structure has not been determined. When it
is confirmed that the monoclonal antibody binds to the
same epitope as the anti-HER2 antibody, the monoclonal
antibody is strongly expected to have an antigenbinding
affinity or biological activity equivalent to
that of the anti-HER2 antibody.
[0058]
(3) Other antibodies
The antibody of the invention includes not only
the above-described monoclonal antibody against HER2
but also a recombinant antibody obtained by artificial
modification for the purpose of decreasing heterologous
antigenicity to humans such
humanized antibody and a
as a chimeric antibody, a
human antibody. These
antibodies can be produced using a known method.
As the chimeric antibody, an antibody in which
antibody variable and constant regions are derived from
different species, for example, a chimeric antibody in
which a mouse- or rat-derived antibody variable region
is connected to a human-derived antibody constant
region can be exemplified (see Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA, 81, 6851-6855, (1984)). Examples of the chimeric
antibody of the present invention can include, but are
not particularly limited to, a chimeric antibody 4D5
- 65 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
comprising a heavy chain constant region of human IgGl
or IgG2.
As the humanized antibody, an antibody obtained by
integrating only a complementarity determining region
(CDR) into a human-derived antibody (see Nature (1986)
321, pp. 522-525), and an antibody obtained by grafting
a part of the amino acid residues of the framework as
well as the CDR sequence to a human antibody by a CDRgrafting
method (WO 90/07861), and an antibody
humanized using gene conversion mutagenesis strategy
(U.S. Patent No. 5821337) can be exemplified.
[0059]
The term "several" as used herein refers to 1 to
10, 1 to 9, 1 to 8, 1 to 7, 1 to 6, 1 to 5, 1 to 4 , 1

substitution is preferably performed within a range
which does not impair the properties of a substance
having the original amino acid sequence.

with
By combining a sequence having a
the above-described heavy chain
high homology
amino acid
sequence with a sequence having a high homology with
the above-described light chain amino acid sequence, it
is possible to select an antibody having a biological
activity equivalent to that of each of the abovedescribed
antibodies. Such a homology is generally a
homology of 80% or more, preferably a homology of 90%
or more, more preferably a homology of 95% or more,
most preferably a homology of 99% or more. Further, by
combining an amino acid sequence wherein one to several
amino acid residues are substituted, deleted or added
in the heavy chain or light chain amino acid sequence,
it is also possible to select an antibody having a
biological activity equivalent to that of each of the
above-described antibodies. The term "homology" as
used herein is used with the same meaning as "identity".

The homology between two amino acid sequences can
be determined using default parameters of Blast
algorithm version 2.2.2 (Altschul, Stephen F., Thomas L.

Zhang, Webb Miller, and David J. Lipman (1997), "Gapped

Further, the antibody of the invention includes a
human antibody which binds to HER2. An anti-HER2 human
antibody refers to a human antibody having only a
sequence of an antibody derived from a human chromosome.
The anti-HER2 human antibody can be obtained by a
method using a human antibody-producing mouse having a
human chromosome fragment comprising heavy and light
chain genes of a human antibody (see Tomizuka, K. et
al., Nature Genetics (1997) 16, pp. 133-143; Kuroiwa, Y.

Further, a method of obtaining a phage displayderived
human antibody selected from a human antibody
library (see Wormstone, I. M. et al., Investigative
Ophthalmology & Visual Science. (2002) 43 (7), pp.
2301-2308; Carmen, S. et al., Briefings in Functional
Genomics and Proteomics (2002), 1 (2), pp. 189-203;

Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
Siriwardena, D. et al., Ophthalmology (2002) 109 (3),
pp. 427-431, etc.) is also known.
For example, a phage display method in which a
variable region of a human antibody is expressed on the
surface of a phage as a single-chain antibody (scFv),
and a phage which binds to an antigen is selected
(Nature Biotechnology (2005), 23, (9), pp. 1105-1116)
can be used.
By analyzing the gene of the phage selected based
on the binding to an antigen, a DNA sequence encoding
the variable region of a human antibody which binds to
an antigen can be determined.
If the DNA sequence of scFv which binds to an
antigen is determined, a human antibody can be obtained
by preparing an expression vector comprising the
sequence and introducing the vector into an appropriate
host to express it (WO 92/01047, WO 92/20791, WO
93/06213, WO 93/11236, WO 93/19172,
95/15388; Annu. Rev. Immunol. (1994)
WO 95/01438, WO

[0066]
As one example of another index for use in the
comparison of the properties of antibodies, the
stability of antibodies can be exemplified. The
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a device
capable of quickly and accurately measuring a thermal
denaturation midpoint temperature (Tm) to be used as a
favorable index of the relative conformational
- 70 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
stability of proteins. By measuring the Tm values
using DSC and comparing the values, a difference in
thermal stability can be compared. It is known that
the storage stability of antibodies shows some
correlation with the thermal stability of antibodies
(Lori Burton, et. al., Pharmaceutical Development and
Technology (2007) 12, pp. 265-273), and a preferred
antibody can be selected by using thermal stability as
an index. Examples of other indices for selecting
antibodies include the following features: the yield in
an appropriate host cell is high; and the aggregability
in an aqueous solution is low. For example, an
antibody which shows the highest yield does not always
show the highest thermal stability, and therefore, it
is necessary to select an antibody most suitable for
the administration to humans by making comprehensive
evaluation based on the above-described indices.

In the present invention, a modified variant of
the antibody is also included. The modified variant
refers to a variant obtained by subjecting the antibody
of the present invention to chemical or biological
modification. Examples of the chemically modified
variant include variants chemically modified by linking
a chemical moiety to an amino acid skeleton, variants
chemically modified with an N-linked or 0-linked
carbohydrate chain, etc. Examples of the biologically
modified variant include variants obtained by post-

translational modification (such as N-linked or 0-
linked glycosylation, N- or C-terminal processing,
deamidation, isomerization of aspartic acid, or
oxidation of methionine), and variants in which a
methionine residue has been added to the N terminus by
being expressed in a prokaryotic host cell. Further,
an antibody labeled so as to enable the detection or
isolation of the antibody or an antigen of the
invention, for example, an enzyme-labeled antibody, a
fluorescence-labeled antibody, and an affinity-labeled
antibody are also included in the meaning of the
modified variant. Such a modified variant of the
antibody of the invention is useful for improving the
stability and blood retention of the antibody, reducing
the antigenicity thereof, detecting or isolating an
antibody or an antigen, and so on.
[0068]
Further, by regulating the modification of a
glycan which is linked to the antibody of the invention
(glycosylation, defucosylation, etc.), it is possible
to enhance an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic
activity. As the technique for regulating the
modification of a glycan of antibodies, WO 99/54342, WO
00/61739, WO 02/31140, etc. are known. However, the
technique is not limited thereto. In the antibody of
the present invention, an antibody in which the
modification of a glycan is regulated is also included.

In the case where an antibody is produced by first
isolating an antibody gene and then introducing the
gene into an appropriate host, a combination of an
appropriate host and an appropriate expression vector
can be used. Specific examples of the antibody gene
include a combination of a gene encoding a heavy chain
sequence of an antibody described in this specification
and a gene encoding a light chain sequence thereof.
When a host cell is transformed, it is possible to
insert the heavy chain sequence gene and the light
chain sequence gene into the same expression vector,
and also into different expression vectors separately.
In the case where eukaryotic cells are used as the
host, animal cells, plant cells, and eukaryotic
microorganisms can be used. As the animal cells,
mammalian cells, for example, simian COS cells (Gluzman,
Y., Cell, (1981)

175-182,
(ATCC No.

dihydrofolate reductase-deficient strains (Urlaub, G.
and Chasin, L.A., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1980) 77,
pp. 4126-4220) of Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHO
cells; ATCC: CCL-61) can be exemplified.
In the case where prokaryotic cells are used, for
example, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis can be
exemplified.
By introducing a desired antibody gene into these
cells through transformation, and culturing the thus
transformed cells in vitro, the antibody can be

obtained. In the above-described culture method, the
yield may sometimes vary depending on the sequence of
the antibody, and therefore, it is possible to select
an antibody which is easily produced as a
pharmaceutical by using the yield as an index among the
antibodies having an equivalent binding activity.
Therefore, in the antibody of the present invention, an
antibody obtained by a method of producing an antibody,
characterized by including a step of culturing the
transformed host cell and a step of collecting a
desired antibody from a cultured product obtained in
the culturing step is also included.
[0069]
It is known that a lysine residue at the carboxyl
terminus of the heavy chain of an antibody produced in
a cultured mammalian cell is deleted (Journal of
Chromatography A, 705: 129-134 (1995)), and it is also
known that two amino acid residues (glycine and lysine)

mammalian cell

antibody produced in a cultured

an

the
carboxyl terminus is amidated (Analytical Biochemistry,
360: 75-83 (2007)) However, such deletion and
modification of the heavy chain sequence do not affect
the antigen-binding affinity and the effector function
(the activation of a complement, the antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity, etc.) of the antibody.
Therefore, in the antibody according to the present
- 74 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
invention, an antibody subjected to such modification
and a functional fragment of the antibody is also
included, and a deletion variant in which one or two
amino acids have been deleted at the carboxyl terminus
of the heavy chain, a variant obtained by amidation of
the deletion variant ( for example, a heavy chain in
which the carboxyl terminal praline residue has been
amidated), and the like are also included. The type of
deletion variant having a deletion at the carboxyl
terminus of the heavy chain of the antibody according
to the invention is not limited to the above variants
as long as the antigen-binding affinity and the
effector function are conserved. The two heavy chains
constituting the antibody according to the invention
may be of one type selected from the group consisting
of a full-length heavy chain and the above-described
deletion variant, or may be of two types in combination
selected therefrom. The ratio of the amount of each
deletion variant can be affected by the type of
cultured mammalian cells which produce the antibody
according to the invention and the culture conditions,
however, a case where one amino acid residue at the
carboxyl terminus has been deleted in both of the two
heavy chains contained as main components in the
antibody according to the invention can be exemplified.

The antitumor compound to be conjugated to the
anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate of the present
invention is explained. The antitumor compound used in
the present invention is not particularly limited
provided it is a compound having an antitumor effect
and a substituent group or a partial structure allowing
connection to a linker structure. When a part or whole
linker is cleaved in tumor cells, the antitumor
compound moiety is released to exhibit the anti tumor
effect of the anti tumor compound. As the linker is
cleaved at a connecting position to the drug, the
anti tumor compound is released in an unmodified
structure to exhibit its intrinsic anti tumor effect.
As the anti tumor compound used in the present
invention, exatecan (((1S,9S)-1-amino-9-ethyl-5-fluoro-

Although having an excellent antitumor effect, exatecan
has not been commercialized as an antitumor drug. The
compound can be easily obtained by a known method and
the amino group at position 1 can be preferably used as
the connecting position to the linker structure.
Further, although exatecan can be also released in
tumor cells while part of the linker is still attached
thereto, it is an excellent compound exhibiting an
excellent antitumor effect even in such a structure.
Because exatecan has a camptothecin structure, it
is known that the equilibrium shifts to a structure
with a closed lactone ring (closed ring) in an aqueous
acidic medium (for example, pH 3 or so) but it shifts
to a structure with an open lactone ring (open ring) in
an aqueous basic medium (for example, pH 10 or so). A
drug conjugate being introduced with an exatecan
residue corresponding to the closed ring structure and
the open ring structure is also expected to have the
same antitumor effect and it is needless to say that
any of these structures is within the scope of the
present invention.

With regard to the antibody-drug conjugate, the
number of conjugated drug molecules per antibody
molecule is a key factor having an influence on
efficacy and safety. Production of the antibody-drug
conjugate is performed by defining the reaction
conditions including the amounts of raw materials and
reagents used for the reaction so as to have a constant
number of conjugated drug molecules. A mixture
containing
molecules

reaction of a low-molecular-weight compound. The
number of drugs conjugated in an antibody molecule is
expressed or specified by the average value, that is,
the average number of conjugated drug molecules.
Unless specifically described otherwise as a principle,
the number of conjugated drug molecules means the
average value except in the case in which it represents
an antibody-drug conjugate having a specific number of
conjugated drug molecules that is included in an
antibody-drug conjugate mixture having different
numbers of conjugated drug molecules.
The number of exatecan molecules conjugated to an
antibody molecule is controllable, and as the average
number of conjugated drug molecules per antibody
molecule, about 1 to 10 exatecans can be connected.

[Production method]
Next, explanations are given for the
representative method for producing the antibody-drug
conjugate of the present invention or a production
intermediate thereof. Meanwhile, the compounds are
hereinbelow described with the compound number shown in

each reaction formula. Specifically, they are referred
to as a "compound of the formula (1) ", a "compound (1) ",
or the like. The compounds with numbers other than
those are also described similarly.
[0098]
1. Production method 1
The antibody-drug conjugate represented by the
formula (1) in which the antibody is connected to the
drug-linker structure via thioether can be produced by
the following method, for example.

Further, the compound of the formula ( 1) in the
above reaction formula may be interpreted as a
structure in which one structure moiety corresponding
from the drug to the linker terminal connects to one
antibody. However, it is only a description given for
the sake of convenience, and there are actually many
cases in which a plurality of the structure moieties
are connected to one antibody

molecule. The same
the product ion method
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
The antibody-drug conjugate (1) can be produced by
reacting the compound (2), which is obtainable by the
method described below, with the antibody (3a) having a
sulfhydryl group.
The antibody (3a) having a sulfhydryl group can be
obtained by a method well known in the art (Hermanson,
G.T, Bioconjugate Techniques, pp. 56-136, pp. 456-493,
Academic Press (1996)). Examples include: Traut's
reagent is reacted with the amino group of the
antibody; N-succinimidyl s-acetylthioalkanoates are
reacted with the amino group of the antibody followed
by reaction with hydroxylamine; after reacting with Nsuccinimidyl
3 - (pyridyldi thio) propionate, the antibody
is reacted with a reducing agent; the antibody is
reacted with a reducing agent such as di thiothrei tol,
2-mercaptoethanol, and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
hydrochloride (TCEP) to reduce the disulfide bond in
the hinge part in the antibody to form a sulfhydryl
group, but it is not limited thereto.
Specifically, using 0.3 to 3 molar equivalents of
TCEP as a reducing agent per disulfide at the hinge
part in the antibody and reacting with the antibody in
a buffer solution containing a chelating agent, the
antibody with partially or completely reduced disulfide
at the hinge part in the antibody can be obtained.
Examples of the chelating agent include ethylenediamine
tetraacetic acid (EDTA)
pentaacetic acid (DTPA).
and diethylenetriamine
It can be used at the
- 95 -
4833-0752-7733.1
Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
concentration of 1 mM to 20 mM. Examples of the buffer
solution which may be used include a solution of sodium
phosphate, sodium borate, or sodium acetate.
Specifically, by reacting the antibody with TCEP at 4°C
to 37°C for 1 to 4 hours, the antibody (3a) having a
partially or completely reduced sulfhydryl group can be
obtained.
Meanwhile, by conducting the reaction for adding a
sulfhydryl group to a drug-linker moiety, the druglinker
moiety can be conjugated by a thioether bond.
Using 2 to 20 molar equivalents of the compound
(2) per the antibody (3a) having a sulfhydryl group,
the antibody-drug conjugate (1) in which 2 to 8 drug
molecules are conjugated per antibody molecule can be
produced. Specifically, it is sufficient that the
solution containing the compound (2) dissolved therein
is added to a buffer solution containing the antibody
(3a) having a sulfhydryl group for the reaction.
Herein, examples of the buffer solution which may be
used include sodium acetate solution, sodium phosphate,
and sodium borate. The pH for the reaction is 5 to 9,
and more preferably the reaction is performed near pH 7.
Examples of the solvent for dissolving the compound (2)
include an organic solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl acetamide
(DMA), and N-methyl-2-pyridone (NMP).
It is sufficient that the organic solvent solution
containing the compound (2) dissolved therein is added

the
reaction. The reaction temperature is O to 37°C, more
preferably 10 to 25°C, and the reaction time is 0.5 to
2 hours. The reaction can be terminated by
deactivating the reactivity of unreacted compound (2)
with a thiol-containing reagent. Examples of the
thiol-containing reagent include cysteine and N-acetylL-
cysteine (NAC) More specifically, 1 to 2 molar
equivalents of NAC are added to the compound (2) used
and, by incubating at room temperature for 10 to 30
minutes, the reaction can be terminated.

[0110]

Common procedure E: Measurement
concentration in antibody-drug conjugate
number of conjugated drug molecules
molecule (1)
of antibody
and average
per antibody
The conjugated drug concentration in the antibodydrug
conjugate can be calculated by measuring UV
absorbance of an aqueous solution of the antibody-drug
conjugate at two wavelengths of 280 nm and 370 nm,
followed by performing the calculation shown below.
Because the total absorbance at any wavelength is
equal to the sum of the absorbance of every lightabsorbing
chemical species that are present in the
system (additivity of absorbance), when the molar
absorption coefficients of the antibody and the drug
remain the same before and after conjugation between
the antibody and the drug, the antibody concentration
and the drug concentration in the antibody-drug
conjugate are expressed by the following equations.

AD, 370+ AA, 370 = ED, 370CD + EA, 370CA
Equation (I)
Equation (II)
In the above, A230 represents the absorbance of an
aqueous solution of the antibody-drug conjugate at 280
nm, A370 represents the absorbance of an aqueous
solution of the antibody-drug conjugate at 370 nm,
AA,280 represents the absorbance of an antibody at 280
nm, AA,37o represents the absorbance of an antibody at
370 nm, AD,280 represents the absorbance of a conjugate
precursor at 280 nm, AD,37o represents the absorbance of
a conjugate precursor at 370 nm, EA,280 represents the
molar absorption coefficient of an antibody at 280 nm,
EA,37o represents the molar absorption coefficient of an
antibody at 370 nm, ED,280 represents the molar
absorption coefficient of a conjugate precursor at 280
nm, ED,37o represents the molar absorption coefficient of
a conjugate precursor at 370 nm, CA represents the
antibody concentration in an antibody-drug conjugate,
and CD represent the drug concentration in an antibodydrug
conjugate.
As for EA, 280, EA, 370, ED, 280, and ED, 370 in the above,
previously prepared values (estimated values based on
calculation or measurement values obtained by UV
measurement of the compounds) are used. For example,
EA,280 can be estimated from the amino acid sequence of
an antibody using a known calculation method (Protein

Atty. Dkt. No. 111119-0105
Science, 1995, vol. 4, 2411-2423). EA,37o is generally
zero. In Examples, as for the molar absorption
coefficient of trastuzumab, EA, 280 2154 0 0 ( estimated
value based on calculation) and EA,37o O were used.
ED,280 and ED,37o can be obtained based on Lambert-Beer's
law (Absorbance molar concentration X molar
absorption coefficient X cell path length) by measuring
the absorbance of a solution in which the conjugate
precursor to be used is dissolved at a certain molar
concentration. As for the molar absorption coefficient
of a drug linker in the Examples, ED, 280 = 50 0 0 (measured
average value) and ED,37o 19000 (measured average
value) were used, unless otherwise specified. By
measuring A230 and A370 of an aqueous solution of the
antibody-drug conjugate and solving the simultaneous
equations (I)

Further, by dividing CD by CA, the average
number of conjugated drug molecules per antibody
molecule can be obtained.

Common procedure F: Measurement ( 2) of average number
of conjugated drug molecules per antibody molecule in
antibody-drug conjugate.
The average number of conjugated drug molecules
per antibody molecule in the antibody-drug conjugate
can also be determined by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) analysis using the following

procedure E.

An antibody-drug conjugate solution (about 1 mg/mL,
60 μL) is mixed with an aqueous solution of
dithiothreitol (DTT) (100 mM, 15 μL) . A sample in
which the disulfide bond between the L chain and the H
chain of the antibody-drug conjugate has been cleaved
by incubating the mixture for 30 minutes at 37°C is
used in HPLC analysis.

[F-3. Data analysis]
[F-3-1] Compared with non-conjugated antibody L (L 0 )
and H (H 0 ) chains, drug-conjugated L (L chain connected
to one drug molecule: Li) and H (H chain connected to
one drug molecule: H1, H chain connected to two drug
molecule: H chain connected to three drug
molecules: H3) chains exhibit higher hydrophobicity in
proportion to the number of conjugated drug molecules
and thus have a larger retention time. These chains
are therefore eluted in the order of Lo and L1 or Ho, H1,
H2, and H3. Detection peaks can be assigned to any of
Lo, L1, Ho, H1, H2, and H3 by the comparison of retention
times with L0 and Ho.
[F-3-2] Since the drug linker has UV absorption, peak
area values are corrected in response to the number of
conjugated drug linker molecules according to the
following expression using the molar absorption
coefficients of the Lor H chain and the drug linker.

Here, as for the molar absorption coefficient (280
nm) of the L or H chain of each antibody, a value
estimated from the amino acid sequence of the L or H
chain of each antibody by a known calculation method
(Protein Science, 1995, vol. 4, 2411-2423) can be used.
In the case of trastuzumab, a molar absorption
coefficient of 26150 and a molar absorption coefficient
of 81290 were used as estimated values for the Land H
chains, respectively, according to its amino acid
sequence. As for the molar absorption coefficient (280
nm) of the drug linker, the measured molar absorption
coefficient (280 nm) of a compound in which the
maleimide group was converted to succinimide thioether
by the reaction of each drug linker with
mercaptoethanol or N-acetylcysteine was used.

A compound represented by the formula (21) can be
produced by using or applying the method described in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-60351 or the
literature (J. Org. Chem., Vol. 51, page 3196, 1986),
and by conducting removal of the protecting groups or
modification of the functional groups, if necessary.
Furthermore, it can be also obtained by treating an
amino acid with a protected terminal amino group or an
acid amide of an oligopeptide with protected amino
group with an aldehyde or a ketone.
By reacting the compound ( 21) with the compound
(22) having a hydroxyl group at a temperature ranging
from under temperature conditions of cooling to room
temperature in an inert solvent in the presence of an
acid or a base, the compound (23) can be produced.
Here, examples of the acid which may be used
include an inorganic acid such as hydrofluoric acid,
hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid,
phosphoric acid, and boric acid; an organic acid such
as acetic acid, citric acid, paratoluene sulfonic acid,
and methanesulfonic acid; and a Lewis acid such as
tetrafluoroborate, zinc chloride, tin chloride,
aluminum chloride, and iron chloride. Among these, a
sulfonic acid, in particular, paratoluene sulfonic acid
is preferable. As for the base, any one of the already
mentioned bases can be suitably selected and used.
Preferred examples thereof include an alkali metal

alkoxide such as potassium tert-butoxide, an alkali
metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide and potassium
hydroxide; an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal
hydride such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride;
an organometallic
lithium such as
base represented by dialkylamino
lithium diisopropylamide; and an
organometallic base of bissilylamine such as lithium
bis(trimethylsilyl)amide.
Examples of the solvent to be used for the
reaction include an ether
tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-dioxane;
solvent
and an
such as
aromatic
hydrocarbon solvent such as benzene and toluene. Those
solvents can be prepared as a mixture with water.
Further, the protecting group for an amino group
as exemplified by P5 is not particularly limited
provided it is a group commonly used for protection of
an amino group. Representative examples include the
protecting groups for an amino group that are described
in Production method 2. However, in the present
reaction, there may be cases in which the protecting
group for an amino group as exemplified by P5 is
cleaved off. In such cases, a protecting group can be
introduced again by appropriately performing a reaction
with a suitable reagent for protecting an amino group
as may be required.
The compound (24) can be produced by removing the
protecting group P6 of the compound (23) . Herein,
representative examples of the protecting group for a

desirable in this case that the protecting group P5 for
an amino group and protecting group P6 for a carboxy
group are the protecting groups that can be removed by
a different method or different conditions. For
example, a representative example includes a
combination in which P5 is a 9-fluorenylmethyloxy
carbonyl group and P6 is a benzyl group. The
protecting groups can be selected depending on, e.g.,
the properties of a compound having the amino group and
the carboxy group to be protected. For removal of the
protecting groups, reagents and conditions are selected
depending on the protecting group.
The compound (26) can be produced by derivatizing
the carboxylic acid (24) into an active ester, mixed
acid anhydride, acid halide, or the like and reacting
it with the compound (4) or a pharmacologically
acceptable salt thereof to produce the compound ( 2 5)
followed by removing the protecting group P5 of the
compound (25) obtained. For the reaction between the
compound (4) and the carboxylic acid (24) and the
reaction for removing the protecting group P6
, the same
reagents and reaction conditions as those described for
Production method 2 can be used.

obtained. The protecting group for an amino group as
represented by P7 is not particularly limited provided
it is generally used for protection of an amino group.
Representative examples thereof include the protecting
groups for an amino group that are described in
Production method 2. For removing the protecting group,
reagents and conditions are selected depending on the
protecting group. For the reaction between the
compound (26) and the compound (27), reaction reagents

synthesis can be employed. The compound (10b) produced
by the aforementioned method can be derivatized into
the compound (1) of the present invention according to

in the compound (33), the protecting group P6 for a
carboxy group and the protecting group P7 for an amino
group are protecting groups that can be removed by the
same method or the same conditions. For example, a
representative example includes a combination in which
P6 is a benzyl ester group and P7 is a benzyloxy
carbonyl group.
The compound (34) can be produced by removing the
protecting group P6 for the carboxy group of the

P7 for the amino group, and furthermore, the compound
(34) can be produced simply by removing at once both of
the protecting groups P6 and P7 that can be removed by
the same method or the same conditions.
The compound (17b) can be produced by reacting the

the anti-HER2
antibody-drug conjugate contained in the pharmaceutical

pharmaceutical effect even at a small dosage when the
antibody-drug conjugate has a higher affinity for an
antigen, that is, a higher affinity (= lower Kd value)
in terms of the dissociation constant (that is, Kd
value) for the antigen. Thus, for determining the
dosage of the antibody-drug conjugate, the dosage can
be determined in view of the situation relating to the

Fourteen vials of 440 mg/vial Herceptin (Genentech,
Inc.) were dissolved in 2 L of cation-exchange
chromatography buffer A (25 mM citrate buffer, 30 mM
NaCl, pH 5.0) and filtered through a 0.2 μm filter
(Millipore Corp.: Stericup 0.22 μm, GVPVDF Membrane).
The samples were applied to a cation-exchange
chromatography column (SP Sepharose HP 240 ml, XK50
column), followed by elution under a NaCl concentration
linear gradient from 30 mM to 500 mM using cationexchange
chromatography buffer B (25 mM citrate buffer,
